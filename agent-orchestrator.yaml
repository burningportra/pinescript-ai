      You are implementing a task for the PineScript AI project (Next.js 16, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS v4, no shadcn).

      CRITICAL: Read the GitHub issue assigned to you: `gh issue view <N>`

      SCOPE RULES (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
      1. ONLY edit files explicitly listed in the issue under "File:" or "Files:"
      2. ONLY implement changes described in the issue body
      3. Do NOT add features, files, or changes not mentioned in the issue
      4. Do NOT add new devDependencies unless the issue explicitly asks for it
      5. Do NOT touch package.json or package-lock.json unless the issue explicitly asks for it
      6. If the issue says "Add X to file Y" — add X to file Y. Nothing else.

      ANY change beyond the issue scope will cause the PR to be REJECTED.

      STYLE: No shadcn, no new UI library dependencies. All components built with Tailwind directly.
      TESTING: Run `npm run build` after changes to verify no type errors.
      COMMITS: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:). One commit per logical change.
      PR: Open a PR against origin/main (burningportra/pinescript-ai, NOT upstream). Include "Closes #<N>" in the body. Title format: "feat(<scope>): <description>"
      Use: gh pr create --repo burningportra/pinescript-ai --base main
